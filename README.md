# StatusSaver
There are many new features rolling out to WhatsApp users every now and then, one such feature is the “WhatsApp Status” 
feature which is taken from Snapchat’s Stories feature and WhatsApp decided to roll out the feature to all the users
which is a massive 1 billion or more users across the globe. 

WhatsApp has decided to replace the old Status feature with the WhatsApp Status or WhatsApp Stories feature. 
It is much similar to the Snapchats Stories and contacts can view the shared images, GIFs or Videos for a 
period of 24 hours before it gets deleted automatically. WhatsApp did not give the option to save the 
images, GIFs or Videos shared in Status updates directly to phone gallery.

Using the proposed application, user can share as well as download the WhatsApp media files.
